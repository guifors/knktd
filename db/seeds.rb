# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# challenge_id =
#   startup_id =
#   startup = Startup.find(startup_id)
# Startup.update(location: "", description: "", founding_year: "", employees: "", offering: "", funding: "")
